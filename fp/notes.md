# Functional Programming

## What is Functional Programming

defined by Eric Elliot

Functional Programming is the process of building software by COMPOSING PURE FUNCTIONS,
avoiding SHARED STATE, MUTABLE DATA, and SIDE EFFECTS.

Functional Programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows
through pure functions

1. Avoid SideEffects
2. Avoid Mutations
3. Avoid SharedState
4. use Pure Functions
5. use Function Composition
6. use Declarative code instead of Imperative code
